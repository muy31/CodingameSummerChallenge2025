# CodingameSummerChallenge2025
My submission for the Codingame Summer Challenge 2025: Soak Overflow!

## My final submission placement (170th/3859 submissions), with 16,994 registrants: https://www.codingame.com/challengereport/73299215241f480af8301b73b690e4debab285f7

## Post-Mortem Incoming (WIP)!

I began the competition with a straightforward approach that overtime grew into my final submission.

At the center, my ideas were:
- Each of my agents should figure out who to shoot at when they are able to shoot (or if they should hold a shot if no option does damage)
- My agents should be able to determine good opportunities to throw bombs, without waste
- My agents should understand how to move pseudo-optimally
- My agents should be able to communicate this information to each other, to prevent collisions during movement, and wasted shooting at essentially killed enemies

Main agent ignorances:
- Beyond probabilistic heuristics, the agent only has a 1-turn search depth and doesn't search extensively over enemy's possible moves
- The player code doesn't keep track of the point score or calculate that score when evaluating it's move

See the statement below: 

## Statement

### 	Goal
Win the water fight by controlling the most territory, or out-soak your opponent!
### 	Rules
The game is played on a grid.

Each player controls a team of agents.

Each turn, every agent can perform one move action and/or one combat action.


### üî• Agents
Agents are the player-controlled units on the field. They possess attributes and actions.

Each agent has a wetness meter, which goes up when getting attacked by enemy agents. Once an agent‚Äôs wetness reaches 100, they are eliminated and removed from play.

Agents also have a set soaking_power and optimal_range. The power indicates how much wetness they normally deal, while the range is used to apply a penalty if the target is too far.

Up to the optimal_range, shooting deals 100% of their soaking_power.
Beyond that, and up to twice the optimal_range, shooting only deals 50% of their soaking_power.
Beyond that, the shot fails.
Note: All distances are calculated with the Manhattan formula.

Each agent also has a shoot_cooldown, which is the amount of turns they must wait after shooting to be able to SHOOT again. They can still use other actions in the meantime.

In addition to shooting, each agent has a set amount of splash bombs that they can throw. The amount is determined at the start of the game and can differ between agents.


### üé¨ Actions
On each turn, you must output one command for each agent that you control. Each command can contain several actions; at most one move action and one combat action.

You can instruct the actions in any order you want, but the execution order will depend on each action‚Äôs priority; see the Action order per turn section for more details.

Moving is done with the MOVE x y command. With it, the agent will attempt to move to the location x, y. If the target location is not orthogonally adjacent to the agent, then they will attempt to move towards it using the shortest valid path possible. If the action results in a movement on a tile with a cover or another agent on it, the movement will be cancelled. If agents collide while attempting to MOVE, their movement will be cancelled.

There are several combat actions available:

SHOOT id: Attempt to shoot agent agentId. This will deal wetness according to the optimalRange and soakingPower of the agent, and is reduced by any damage reduction gained by the target agent (see the HUNKER_DOWNaction and the Cover section).
THROW x y: Attempt to throw a splash bomb at the location x, y. Splash bombs can only be thrown at a maximum distance of 4 tiles away from the agent. They deal 30 wetness to agents on the tile it lands on and to all adjacent tiles (orthogonally and diagonally). This action ignores damage reduction from covers & hunkering.
HUNKER_DOWN: Hunker down to gain 25% damage reduction against enemy shots this turn. This can be stacked with cover bonuses (see the Cover section below).
See the Game Protocol section for more information on sending commands to your agents.


### üõ°Ô∏è Cover
Each tile of the grid is given to your program through the standard input. For each column of each row you are given a tileType. It can now have one of three possible values:

0 an empty tile.
1 a tile containing low cover.
2 a tile containing high cover.
Tiles with cover are impassable, and agents will automatically path around them when perform a MOVE action.

An agent that benefits from a cover will gain damage reduction against enemy shots. Low Covers provide 50% protection, and High Covers provide 75% protection.

For instance, an agent within optimal range and a soaking power of 24 will only deal 6 wetness to an enemy behind High Cover.

To benefit from a cover, the agent must be orthogonally adjacent to it, and the enemy shot must come from the opposite side of the cover tile. The cover is ignored if both agents are adjacent to the cover.

In the case where multiple covers can be considered, only the highest cover will count.


#### Examples:


An agent orthogonally adjacent to the left side of a low cover. Shooting this agent from a green tile will result in damage reduction.

In the case where a shot can be affected by two covers, only the highest one counts.

An agent that is not orthogonally adjacent to any cover, thus not benefitting from their damage reduction.

The orange agent benefits from a low cover while the purple agent does not benefit from any cover.

Neither of these agents benefit from the cover from each other since they are both adjacent to it.
Note: Hunkering down stacks with cover, which means the total protection gained from both taking cover and hunkering down is 75% or 100%, for low and high cover respectively.


### üìà Points
You gain points by taking control of tiles when you control a larger area than your opponent.

Any tile that is closer to one of your agents than to an enemy agent is considered to be under your control. However, if an agent has wetness greater or equal to 50, the distance to that agent will be doubled during this comparison.

Each turn, if you control more tiles than your opponent, you score as many points as extra tiles that you control compared to your opponent.


### üé¨ Action order for one turn
Game turns are synchronous, for both players and agents (meaning all agents perform their actions at the same time). However, some actions have priority over others:

MOVE actions go first,
Then HUNKER_DOWN actions,
Then SHOOT and THROW,
And finally, the removal of any soaked agent.

### Victory Conditions
The winner is the player who fulfills one of the following conditions:

Reach 600 more points than their opponent
Eliminate all opposing agents
Have the most points after 100 turns
### Defeat Conditions
Your program does not provide a command in the alloted time or one of the commands is invalid.

### üêû Debugging tips
Hover over the grid to see extra information on the tile under your mouse.
Assign the special MESSAGE text action to an agent and that text will appear above your agent.
Press the gear icon on the viewer to access extra display options.
Use the keyboard to control the action: space to play/pause, arrows to step 1 frame at a time.

### 	Game Protocol
#### Initialization Input
First line: one integer myId, for your player identification.
Second line: one integer agentDataCount for the number of agents on the grid.

Next agentDataCount lines: The following 6 inputs for each agent:

agentId: unique id of this agent
player: id of the player owning this agent
shootCooldown: min number or turns between two shots for this agent
optimalRange: the optimal shooting range of this agent
soakingPower: the maximum wetness damage output of this agent
splashBombs: the starting amount of splash bombs available to this agent
Next line: two integers width and height for the size of the grid.

The next width * height lines: The following 3 inputs for each tile on the grid:

x: X coordinate (0 is leftmost)
y: Y coordinate (0 is uppermost)
tile_type:
0 for an empty tile
1 for a low cover
2 for a high cover
Input for one game turn
First line: one integer agentCount for the number of remaining agents on the grid.

Next agentCount lines: The following 6 inputs for each agent:

agentId: unique id of this agent
x: X coordinate (0 is leftmost)
y: Y coordinate (0 is uppermost)
cooldown: number of turns left until this agent can shoot again
splashBombs: current amount of splash bombs available to this agent
wetness: current wetness of the agent
Next line: one integer myAgentCount for the number of agents controlled by the player.

#### Output
A single line per agent, preceded by its agentId and followed by its action(s):

Up to one move action:
MOVE x y: Attempt to move towards the location x, y.
Up to one combat action:
SHOOT id: Attempt to shoot agent agentId.
THROW: Attempt to throw a splash bomb at the location x, y.
HUNKER_DOWN: Hunker down to gain 25% damage reduction against enemy attacks this turn.
Up to one message action:
MESSAGE text: Display text in the viewer. Useful for debugging.
Instructions are separated by semicolons. For example, consider the following line:

3;MOVE 12 3;SHOOT 5

This instructs agent 3 to move towards the coordinates (12, 3) and to shoot agent 5.

Note: The agentId at the start can be omitted. In that case, the actions are assigned to the agents in ascending order of agentId.

#### Constraints
Response time per turn ‚â§ 50ms
Response time for the first turn ‚â§ 1000ms
12 ‚â§ width ‚â§ 20
6 ‚â§ height ‚â§ 10
